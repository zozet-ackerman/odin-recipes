        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon dired oregano</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon ground thyme</li>

        <li>½ cup chicken brith, divided</li>

        <li>1 (16 ounce) package of your

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather ingredients. preheat the oven
             to 175 degrees C</li>

        <li>Place chicken breasts on a flat work
             surface. Slice horizontally through
              the middle, being careful not to cut 
              all the way through to the other side.
               Open the 2 sides and spread them out
                like an open book to butterfly.</li>

        <li>Melt butter in a large, oven-safe
             skillet over medium-high heat. Add 
             garlic, oregano, thyme. Sauté until
              fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
    
        <li>Add chicken and cook until golden 
            brown but not fully cooked, 3 to 4
             minutes per side.</li>

        <li>Pour 1/4 cup chicken broth into the
            skillet and bake in the preheated 
            oven until chicken is no longer pink
             in the centers and juices run clear
             , about 15 minutes.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large
             skillet and cook over medium-high heat
             , turning occasionally, until evenly 
             browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon
              slices on paper towels and let cool 
              enough to handle, about 5
               minutes; chop.</li>

        <li>At the same time, bring a
             large pot of lightly salted water 
             to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta
              in the boiling water, stirring 
              occasionally, until tender yet 
              firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes.
               Drain and keep warm.</li>

        <li>Remove skillet from the oven and 
            transfer chicken to a plate, reserving
             juices in the skillet. Keep chicken
              warm and place skillet 
              on the stovetop.</li>

        <li>Whisk flour into the skillet over
             medium heat. Add remaining chicken
              broth, Parmesan cheese, and 
              whipping cream. Whisk until
               combined.</li>
        
        <li>Add sun-dried tomatoes, red pepper flakes
            , and salt. Add bacon and chicken back into
             the skillet.</li>

        <li>Serve on top of hot cooked pasta.</li>

        <li>Enjoy!</li>
